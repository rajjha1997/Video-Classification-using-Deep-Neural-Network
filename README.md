# Video-Classification-using-Deep-Neural-Network
In the video classification problem, the objective is to train the computer to classify the videos into their respective categories which can be for the whole video or on the video frame level. There are various variations to video classification tasks such as activity recognition, pose detection, object detection which either classify the actions performing in the video or objects present in it.

## Dataset
I have used a UCF-50 dataset for training the model. You can get ths dataset from [here](https://www.crcv.ucf.edu/data/UCF50.php)

## Models Used
1. ConvLSTM2D
2. Transfer Learning ( VGG16 + LSTM )
